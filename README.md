Visualizing previously clustered data (KMeans). Each point is a person's response of a moral questionnaire. 
The questionnaire contains 11 questions made by a liberal point of view and 11 by a conservative point of view. 
On this notebook, I investigate axis and coordinates, more than the whole data file. 
I begin with isolating the mean axis of each group, defined by cosine distances, and their relative distances. 
The final result is a heatmap, by which we can see the relative distances between selected group of people, such as partisan gruops, feminists, declared conservatives etc.
